								<p>About a year and a half ago, when I interned at a biotech start-up called NovellusDX, 
									I expected to be placed in their research division, given my two years
									of hands-on experience in a Bioengineering laboratory at the University
									of California, Los Angeles, where I researched synthetic tissue engineering. 
									Instead, I was placed in their data analysis division, where I immediately 
									discovered a passion for data science, a field relatively unrelated to my 
									major field of study, Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering. My newfound passion for data science was cultivated 
									over only a few short months at NovellusDX, but my experience was so eye-opening 
									that it has since become my goal to pursue career opportunities that might allow 
									me to combine my broad academic and professional experiences in applied research 
									and engineering with my more recent professional experiences in data science. <br>
									<br>At NovellusDX, my work focused mainly on data visualization and analysis of machine 
									learning outputs for the purposes of improving their algorithm’s accuracy in identifying 
									cancerous mutations within a cell line. In the time since, I have worked as a consultant for a biotech 
									start-up called iCardio.AI, at which I extracted data from cardiologist reports and analyzed correlations between 
									various demographic and biological variables with respect to the risk of heart disease. Additionally, I  
									partnered with a fellow UCLA student to work on a project we’ve called “Dr. Playlist,” which has the goal of improving 
									music classification by style, genre, and/or “vibe,” via the development of a machine learning pipeline focusing on 
									variables including types of instruments, chord progressions, key, meter, etc. <br><br>
									Most recently, I enrolled in a data science program through Thinkful to foster a deeper education 
									while pursuing other opportunities in the field. As part of the Thinkful program, I have completed projects 
									involving supervised and unsupervised machine learning, experimental design, and general data visualization. 
									The tools and strategies used in completing these projects have included database querying via SQL, web scraping via Scrapy, 
									dataset analysis with NumPy and Pandas, visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and the various machine learning algorithms
									included in Scikit-learn.<br><br>
									
									Check out my <a href="#work">work</a>, which includes some of my favorite assignments completed within the Thinkful program,
									as well as several functions that I've written to complete various professional and personal projects.<br><br><br></p>
